Comp 20 Private Git Repository

1.  This Repository is for most of my Comp20 assignments and projects.

2.  My Favorite assignment was the marauder's map.  I liked this project because it pushed me 
	to build something that is applicable in the real world.  Google maps are used on countless websites.  It also taught me the power of APIs.  I didn't know that they existed before this assignment, and now I have the capability to find and work with countless API's.

3.  I've definitely grown a lot.  Coming into this class I thought computer science was C++, a 	
	a terminal window and eclipse.  This class has opened my eyes to a whole new area of computer
	science that I was previously blind to.

4.  I've definitely learned a lot about Web Development in terms of the big picture, internet
  	logic, and coding languages.  But I think the most important skill that I have gained is the ability and confidence to learn on my own.  This course has showed me the countless computer science resources that are available and how to access/use them ("Don't reinvent the wheel").
  		ex1) Using the google map API, to step by step get me started with my code, and then 	
  			 referencing it time and time again for help with the finer details.  
  		ex2) The step by step heroku tutorial that we used in lab 8.  I would have been lost 
  			 without it, and it actually took me step by step until I had a toy server application built and working.


5.  This class has sparked my interest in internet security.
