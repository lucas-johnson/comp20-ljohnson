Assignment 4 
By: Lucas Johnson

This webpage is a written report of my security attacks on Will Dolan's assignment 3.  

I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment.

I discussed this project mostly with Will (my assignment partner). I also briefly discussed this project with Naomi Zarrilli and Alex Ravan.
