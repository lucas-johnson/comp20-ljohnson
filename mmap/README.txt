Marauder's Map
By: Lucas Johnson

This webpage uses the google maps API and HTTPRequest POST to create a "marauders map".  
This map shows the various locations of the comp20 class memebers. I worked on this 
project by myself for approximately 10 hours.  I used the haversine formula from this
URI:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript.
