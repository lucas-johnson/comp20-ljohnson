Lab 6

I worked on this assignment alone, and it took me approximately 3 hours.  This lab includes an index.html, a style.css, a data.json, and a lab.js file.  ALl of my work was done on the lab.js file.

Answer to Question: No, it is not possible to request the data from a different origin.  This would violate the Same origin policy.  To grab a resource, for example data.json, you must be on the same domain.
