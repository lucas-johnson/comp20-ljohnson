Captains Log
By Lucas Johnson

This website has a text box where you write a message that is displayed on the page,
along with the exact date of when the message was written.  When the page is 
reloaded, all of the previous messages are still displayed on the page. Jquery and 
localStorage are used.  I worked on this project alone and spent approximately 2 
hours working on it.
